I am a PhD candidate at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy. My interest lies in the philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of mind. My PhD thesis is on predicativism and constructivism, especially the notion of indefinite extensibility of concepts and how we should reason about definite and indefinite concepts. 

I hold a master's degree from the University of Munich in "Logic and Philosophy of Science". During my master's degree, I mainly focused on proof theory, ordinal analysis, and modal set theory.
